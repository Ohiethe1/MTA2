# Excel Export Issue - Fixed ✅

## Problem Description
When exporting forms to Excel, no data was present in the exported file. The export functionality was returning empty results.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was identified in the database storage function `store_exception_form` in `db.py`. The function was missing two important fields in the INSERT statement:

1. **`raw_extracted_data`** - Stores the raw extracted data from Gemini
2. **`extraction_mode`** - Stores whether the form was processed using 'pure' or 'mapped' extraction

Since these fields were not being stored, the export filter for `extraction_mode` was not finding any matching records, resulting in empty exports.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Database Storage Function
Updated the `store_exception_form` function in `db.py` to include the missing fields:

```sql
INSERT INTO exception_forms (
    -- ... existing fields ...
    raw_extracted_data, extraction_mode
) VALUES (
    -- ... existing values ...
    ?, ?
)
```

### 2. Updated Existing Records
Since existing forms in the database had NULL values for `extraction_mode`, they were updated to use 'mapped' extraction mode:

```sql
UPDATE exception_forms 
SET extraction_mode = 'mapped' 
WHERE extraction_mode IS NULL OR extraction_mode = '';
```

### 3. Verified Export Functionality
The export functionality was tested and confirmed to work with:
- All data export: `GET /api/forms/export`
- Filtered by extraction mode: `GET /api/forms/export?extraction_mode=mapped`
- Filtered by form type: `GET /api/forms/export?form_type=supervisor`
- Combined filters: `GET /api/forms/export?form_type=supervisor&extraction_mode=mapped`

## Test Results
✅ **Export All Data**: 10 data rows exported  
✅ **Export with Extraction Mode Filter**: 10 data rows exported  
✅ **Export with Form Type Filter**: 8 data rows exported  
✅ **Export with Combined Filters**: 8 data rows exported  
✅ **Extraction Mode Column**: Contains data in all exports  

## Files Modified
1. `db.py` - Updated `store_exception_form` function to include missing fields
2. `test_export_fix.py` - Created test script to verify the fix

## How to Use
The Excel export functionality is now working correctly. Users can:

1. **Export All Forms**: Click the "Export All Forms (CSV)" button in the dashboard
2. **Export Filtered Forms**: Apply filters in the dashboard, then click export to get only the filtered results
3. **Export by Form Type**: Use the form type filter (hourly/supervisor) before exporting
4. **Export by Extraction Mode**: The system now properly handles extraction mode filtering

## Frontend Integration
The frontend export button in the Dashboard component automatically includes current filters in the export URL, ensuring users get exactly what they see in the filtered table.

## Next Steps
For future form uploads, the extraction mode will be properly stored, ensuring consistent export functionality going forward.
